# CSS342-JollyBanker
 This lab will serve a few purposes. First, it will provide hands-on
 experience using both queues and binary search trees. It will also
 provide an opportunity for further program/class design as the project 
 does not specifically delineate class structure or design.
 
 You will build a banking application which processes transactions. 
 This banking application consists of three phases.
 
1) The program will read in a string of transactions from a file into 
an in-memory queue. These transactions can open accounts, withdraw funds, 
deposit funds, transfer funds, or ask for the transactional history to be 
printed.

2) The program will next read from the queue and process the
transactions in order.

3) When the queue has been depleted the program will print out all 
open accounts and balances in those accounts.
